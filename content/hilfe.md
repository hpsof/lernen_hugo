I am a paragraph in Markdown with line
wrapping so fit in this width.
I am a continuation of the first paragraph
as there is no empty line before me.

I am the second paragraph.


I am the third one. Even though there are
two line breaks before me, this does not
create any newline characters. After me there
are two spaces before the newline character==>  
<==I have line break before me and even though
I am not a new paragraph, I do start on a
new line due to the manual line break via
spaces before the newline character.

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.
